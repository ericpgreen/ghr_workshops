## Observational Findings

[Ding et al. (2015)](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.017341) conducted a pooled analysis of three large prospective cohort studies of health professionals in the U.S. (95% white) followed for up to 36 years:

> Higher consumption of total coffee, caffeinated coffee, and decaffeinated coffee was associated with lower risk of total mortality‚Ä¶Relative to no consumption of coffee, the pooled hazard ratio for death was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91‚Äì0.99) for 1.0 or less cup of total coffee per day.

In other words, the sort of people who drink a cup of coffee daily have a 5% lower risk of dying over 2 to 3 decades. 

## Causal Deniability

Does this mean that coffee prevents death? The study authors say no. But also, maybe!

**Step 1: Avoid the word ‚Äúcausal‚Äù and warn that correlation is not causation.**

> ‚Ä¶given the observational nature of the study design, we could not directly establish a cause-effect relationship between coffee and mortality.

**Step 2: Ignore the warning and make policy or health recommendations based on a causal interpretation of the findings.**

> ‚Ä¶coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy lifestyle‚Ä¶moderate consumption of coffee may confer health benefits in terms of reducing premature death.

## So which is it, a non-causal association or a causal effect? 

[Hern√°n (2018)](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304337) argues that scientists need to stop the charade:

> We need to stop treating "causal" as a dirty word that respectable investigators do not say in public or put in print. It is true that observational studies cannot definitely prove causation, but this statement misses the point‚Ä¶

According to Hern√°n, the point is that we have to be clear about our scientific goals and use language that reflects these goals. 

## What is our goal? What do we want to know?

[B. Whether drinking a cup of coffee daily lowers the risk of dying?]{style="font-size:150%;"}

## To answer this question we need causal inference

## Causal Inference

Causal inference is what we do when we identify and estimate the causal effect of some proposed cause on an outcome of interest.

## Counterfactual Thinking

[Causal inference is an exercise in counterfactual thinking, full of "what if" questions about the road not taken.]{style="font-size:150%; background-color:rgba(244, 186, 2);"}

A counterfactual is the hypothetical state of a "what if" question. With counterfactual thinking, there is what actually happened, and then there is the hypothetical counterfactual of what would have happened, counter to fact, under the alternative scenario. The difference between what did happen and what would have happened is a known as the causal effect.

## The Road Not Taken

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and sorry I could not travel both and be one traveler‚Ä¶

Robert has to choose one road; he can't take both simultaneously. Robert can either take the road more traveled, a decision we'll call ùëã = 0, or he can take the road less traveled, a decision we‚Äôll call ùëã = 1.
